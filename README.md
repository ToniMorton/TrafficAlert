# TrafficAlert

Thanks for downloading my script! 
if you need any help feel free to add me on discord: ToniMorton#3472

This is a *modernized* and simplified version of the older TrafficAlert Script i worked on previously
you can edit *Client.lua* slightly if you wish to change the color of the text or remove the coloring
you can also edit the title of the notifcation but be careful not to break the script!


to use this.

Extract the TrafficAlert Folder to your Server Resources

Edit your Server.cfg or use Txadmin to edit the config and add the following line to your config

start TrafficAlert

Thats it!
